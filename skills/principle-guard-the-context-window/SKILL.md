# Guard the Context Window

## Portability (required)

This skill is part of the portable **pstack** pack for multiple coding agents.

1. Read `pstack` skill `references/capability-contract.md` (or this skill's `references/capability-contract.md` if present).
2. Detect the runtime and read one adapter before any delegation:
   - Cursor → `references/adapters/cursor.md` (under the `pstack` or `poteto-mode` skill)
   - Codex → `references/adapters/codex.md`
   - Anything else / unsure → `references/adapters/generic.md`
3. Translate upstream Cursor mechanics through the adapter. Do **not** invent Cursor `Task` / `poteto-agent` / model slugs on runtimes that lack them.
4. If multi-agent tools are unavailable, collapse parallel work onto the main agent and say so briefly.

Capability verbs: `explore`, `implement`, `review`, `parallel`, `ask_user`, `verify`, `model_role`.


The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token that enters should earn its place.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress. Unlike compute or time, context spent inside a session cannot be reclaimed.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Don't read what you won't use.** Read selectively based on relevance. If a file isn't needed for the current task, skip it.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
