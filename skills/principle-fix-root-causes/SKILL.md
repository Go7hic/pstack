# Fix Root Causes

## Portability (required)

This skill is part of the portable **pstack** pack for multiple coding agents.

1. Read `pstack` skill `references/capability-contract.md` (or this skill's `references/capability-contract.md` if present).
2. Detect the runtime and read one adapter before any delegation:
   - Cursor → `references/adapters/cursor.md` (under the `pstack` or `poteto-mode` skill)
   - Codex → `references/adapters/codex.md`
   - Anything else / unsure → `references/adapters/generic.md`
3. Translate upstream Cursor mechanics through the adapter. Do **not** invent Cursor `Task` / `poteto-agent` / model slugs on runtimes that lack them.
4. If multi-agent tools are unavailable, collapse parallel work onto the main agent and say so briefly.

Capability verbs: `explore`, `implement`, `review`, `parallel`, `ask_user`, `verify`, `model_role`.


When debugging, do not paper over symptoms. Trace every problem to its root cause and fix it there.

**Why:** Symptom fixes accumulate. Each workaround makes the system harder to reason about, and the real bug remains. Root-cause fixes are slower upfront but reduce total debugging time.

**Pattern:**
- Reproduce first (if you can't reproduce it, you can't verify your fix)
- Ask "why" until you hit the root cause
- Resist the urge to add guards (adding a nil check to silence a crash is a symptom fix)
- If a workaround needs a paragraph-long comment to justify it, the code is wrong (fix the code, not the comment)
- Check for the pattern, not just the instance (grep for the same pattern, fix all instances)
- When stuck, instrument. Don't guess (add logging, read the actual error)

**Restart bugs: suspect state before code**

Code doesn't change between runs. State does. When something "fails after restart," suspect stale persistent state first: config files, caches, lock files, serialized state. If clearing a state file restores behavior, prioritize state validation as the fix.
