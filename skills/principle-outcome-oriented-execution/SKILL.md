# Outcome-Oriented Execution

## Portability (required)

This skill is part of the portable **pstack** pack for multiple coding agents.

1. Read `pstack` skill `references/capability-contract.md` (or this skill's `references/capability-contract.md` if present).
2. Detect the runtime and read one adapter before any delegation:
   - Cursor → `references/adapters/cursor.md` (under the `pstack` or `poteto-mode` skill)
   - Codex → `references/adapters/codex.md`
   - Anything else / unsure → `references/adapters/generic.md`
3. Translate upstream Cursor mechanics through the adapter. Do **not** invent Cursor `Task` / `poteto-agent` / model slugs on runtimes that lack them.
4. If multi-agent tools are unavailable, collapse parallel work onto the main agent and say so briefly.

Capability verbs: `explore`, `implement`, `review`, `parallel`, `ask_user`, `verify`, `model_role`.


Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible
- Always run final verification before declaring done

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion
