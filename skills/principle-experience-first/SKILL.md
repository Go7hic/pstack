# Experience First

## Portability (required)

This skill is part of the portable **pstack** pack.

1. Read the `pstack` capability contract and the adapter for the active coding agent before any helper delegation.
2. Prefer capability verbs (`explore`, `implement`, `review`, `parallel`, `ask_user`, `verify`, `model_role`) over vendor tool names.
3. Resolve models through `model_role`. Never require a vendor-specific model identifier.
4. When helper spawning is unavailable, run the work on the lead agent and state that fan-out was collapsed.

The product is the experience. Every technical decision either helps or hurts it. When implementation convenience conflicts with user delight, choose delight.

- Say no to 1,000 things (every feature, control, and option must earn its place)
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Sweat the details (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

The user is whoever consumes the work. For a UI that is the end user. For a library or an internal API it is the colleague who imports it. The engineer who maintains the code next is a user too. Weigh their experience the same way, and explain impact from their seat.

Foundations should serve the experience, not the other way around. Foundational thinking governs the *sequence* of work; this principle governs the *target*.
