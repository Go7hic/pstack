# Exhaust the Design Space

## Portability (required)

This skill is part of the portable **pstack** pack for multiple coding agents.

1. Read `pstack` skill `references/capability-contract.md` (or this skill's `references/capability-contract.md` if present).
2. Detect the runtime and read one adapter before any delegation:
   - Cursor → `references/adapters/cursor.md` (under the `pstack` or `poteto-mode` skill)
   - Codex → `references/adapters/codex.md`
   - Anything else / unsure → `references/adapters/generic.md`
3. Translate upstream Cursor mechanics through the adapter. Do **not** invent Cursor `Task` / `poteto-agent` / model slugs on runtimes that lack them.
4. If multi-agent tools are unavailable, collapse parallel work onto the main agent and say so briefly.

Capability verbs: `explore`, `implement`, `review`, `parallel`, `ask_user`, `verify`, `model_role`.


When a novel interaction or architectural decision has no established precedent, explore several concrete alternatives before implementation. Building the wrong thing costs more than exploring three options.

**The rule.** When the right answer is not obvious, build 2-3 competing prototypes or sketches. Compare them side by side. Only then commit. Design it twice is this rule by another name. A second flavor of the first shape does not count.

**When it applies:**
- Novel UI interactions (no prior art in the codebase)
- Architectural choices with multiple viable approaches
- Product design decisions where user experience depends on feel, not logic

**When it doesn't:**
- Mechanical implementation where the pattern is established
- Bug fixes or refactors with a clear target state
- Changes where constraints dictate a single viable approach
